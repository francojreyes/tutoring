Suppose we are building a fighting game (like Mortal Kombat). We want to
create a program that tell us what Combo the player entered.

We start with a list of Combo sequences and the attack they map to, e.g.:
   X X Y -> Torment
   X X   -> The Damned
   X     -> Straight Punch
   Y X   -> Banished
   Y X Y -> Dark Soul
   Y     -> Specter Strike

We then get the sequence of buttons the user pressed, one by one, e.g.
    X,  Y,  X,  X,  Y

After each button press we want to know - what's the best (longest) Combo
the player can do? For example, for the input above:
    X,  Y,  X,  X,  Y
     |   |   |   |   |_ At this point, the best Combo is Dark Soul (XXY)
     |   |   |   |_ At this point, the best Combo is The Damned (XX)
     |   |   |_ At this point, the best Combo is Banished (YX)
     |   |_ At this point, the best Combo is Specter Strike (Y)
     |_ At this point, the best Combo is Straight Punch (X)
